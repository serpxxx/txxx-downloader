## 1. Introduction

TXXX is a video hosting site that commonly uses a KVS-style player configuration with MP4 and HLS variants. The site exposes direct media URLs in player configuration blocks or inline JavaScript, which can be extracted and downloaded with standard tooling.

### 1.1 Research Scope

- TXXX watch pages and embed endpoints
- Player configuration payloads (flashvars, JSON, or inline scripts)
- HLS manifests and MP4 direct file URLs
- Common CDN hostnames and URL query patterns

### 1.2 Methodology

- Inspect player initialization scripts for video_url, hls, and file keys
- Capture network requests while playback starts
- Validate URLs with yt-dlp and ffprobe
- Document stream variants by quality and codec

---

## 2. TXXX Video Infrastructure Overview

### 2.1 Video Hosting Types

- Direct MP4 files hosted on CDN
- HLS streams exposed via m3u8 playlists
- Thumbnail and preview assets hosted on static subdomains

### 2.2 CDN Architecture

- Primary site domain: txxx.com
- CDN patterns: cdn.txxx.com, s1.txxx.com, s2.txxx.com
- KVS get_file endpoint as the gateway to media assets

### 2.3 Video Processing Pipeline

1. User loads watch page
2. Player script assembles flashvars / JSON config
3. video_url or hls_url is resolved via get_file
4. Client requests MP4 or m3u8 from CDN

### 2.4 Access Control and Authentication

- Most public videos are accessible without auth
- Some videos require session cookies or age gate confirmation
- Signed URLs may expire; capture fresh URLs near download time

---

## 3. URL Patterns and Detection

### 3.1 Watch Page URL Patterns

```
https://txxx.com/video/<slug>/
https://txxx.com/video/<id>/<slug>/
https://txxx.com/videos/<slug>/
```

### 3.2 Embed URL Patterns

```
https://txxx.com/embed/<id>
https://txxx.com/embed/<id>?autoplay=1
```

### 3.3 Direct Media and CDN URL Patterns

```
https://txxx.com/get_file/<hash>/<id>/<quality>.mp4
https://txxx.com/get_file/<hash>/<id>/playlist.m3u8
https://cdn.txxx.com/videos/<id>/<file>.mp4
```

### 3.4 Regex Patterns for URL Extraction

```regex
txxx\.com/video/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)
txxx\.com/embed/([0-9]+)
get_file/[^/]+/([0-9]+)/
```

### 3.5 Command-line URL Extraction

```bash
grep -oE "https?://[^'\" ]+\.(mp4|m3u8|m4s|ts)" page.html | sort -u
grep -oE "txxx\.com/(video|embed)/[^'\" ]+" page.html | sort -u
```

## 4. Stream Formats and CDN Analysis

### 4.1 Stream Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| MP4 (progressive) | .mp4 | Direct file URLs; easiest to download |
| HLS (adaptive) | .m3u8 | Playlist-based; download via yt-dlp or ffmpeg |
| fMP4 segments | .m4s | Segmented assets referenced by HLS playlists |

### 4.2 Typical Quality Ladder

| Quality | Typical Resolution | Notes |
|---------|--------------------|-------|
| Low | 360p - 480p | Fast preview streams or mobile variants |
| Medium | 720p | Common default for web playback |
| High | 1080p+ | Available when source uploads are higher quality |

### 4.3 CDN URL Construction and Query Parameters

- get_file URLs often include a hash segment and short-lived tokens
- Quality is commonly encoded in the filename or path
- Referer and Origin headers can affect access

### 4.4 Validation and Inspection Commands

```bash
ffprobe -hide_banner -show_streams "video.mp4"
ffprobe -hide_banner -show_format "video.mp4"
ffprobe -hide_banner -i "playlist.m3u8"
```

## 5. yt-dlp Implementation Strategies

yt-dlp can parse direct MP4 URLs or HLS manifests. Use cookies when content is gated and prefer format selection to control quality.

### 5.1 Basic Usage

```bash
yt-dlp [OPTIONS] [--] URL [URL...]
yt-dlp -F "https://example.com/watch/123"
```

### 5.2 Authentication and Cookies

- Use --cookies-from-browser to re-use a logged-in session if required
- Pass referer headers with --add-header when the CDN enforces origin checks

### 5.3 Format Selection and Output Templates

```bash
yt-dlp -f bestvideo+bestaudio/best "URL"
yt-dlp -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "URL"
yt-dlp --download-archive archive.txt "URL"
```

### 5.4 Site-Specific Examples

```bash
yt-dlp "https://txxx.com/video/<slug>/"
yt-dlp -F "https://txxx.com/video/<slug>/"
yt-dlp -f best "https://txxx.com/video/<slug>/"
```

### 5.5 Batch and Archive Mode

```bash
yt-dlp -a urls.txt --download-archive archive.txt
yt-dlp --no-overwrites --continue "URL"
```

### 5.6 Error Handling Patterns

- Use --retries and --fragment-retries for flaky HLS
- If 403/401 occurs, refresh cookies or add referer headers
- Use --downloader aria2c for large MP4 files

---

## 6. FFmpeg Processing Techniques

FFmpeg is useful for remuxing HLS playlists into MP4 and validating codecs without re-encoding.

### 6.1 Inspect and Validate Streams

```bash
ffprobe -hide_banner -i "playlist.m3u8"
ffmpeg -i "playlist.m3u8" -c copy output.mp4
```

### 6.2 Common Remux and Repair Patterns

```bash
ffmpeg -i "playlist.m3u8" -c copy output.mp4
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4
ffprobe -hide_banner -show_streams output.mp4
```

## 7. Alternative Tools and Backup Methods

### 7.1 Streamlink

```bash
streamlink "https://txxx.com/video/<slug>/" best -o output.mp4
streamlink --loglevel debug "URL" best
```

### 7.2 aria2c

```bash
aria2c -o video.mp4 "https://cdn.txxx.com/videos/<id>/<file>.mp4"
aria2c -i urls.txt -j 4
```

### 7.3 gallery-dl

```bash
gallery-dl "https://txxx.com/video/<slug>/"
gallery-dl -g "URL"
```

### 7.4 Browser DevTools

- Filter Network tab for m3u8, mp4, or get_file requests
- Check player initialization scripts for video_url or hls_url
- Copy request URL as cURL to preserve headers

---

## 8. TXXX API Integration

### 8.1 Known Endpoints

- GET https://txxx.com/api/videofile.php?video_id=<id>

### 8.2 Example Requests

```bash
curl -L 'https://txxx.com/api/videofile.php?video_id=<id>'
```

### 8.3 Token and Session Handling

- API responses may return a base64-encoded video_url
- Decode URL then download via yt-dlp or ffmpeg

---

## 9. Implementation Recommendations

### 9.1 Detection Hierarchy

- Parse inline player config for direct MP4 URLs
- Fallback to HLS playlist URLs (m3u8)
- If both are absent, scan Network logs for get_file requests

### 9.2 Site-Specific Notes

- Prefer direct MP4 when available for fastest downloads
- Cache resolved URLs briefly; refresh if tokenized
- Surface download buttons near player and in grids where possible

### 9.3 Storage and Naming Strategy

- Use %(title)s.%(ext)s output templates to preserve context
- Store archives to prevent duplicate downloads

---

## 10. Troubleshooting and Edge Cases

- HLS playlists may rotate segments; retry on 404
- Age-gate or consent modals can block player config
- Some videos are externally embedded and require provider-specific handling

---

## 11. Conclusion

TXXX uses a KVS-style delivery model with MP4 and HLS variants. A robust downloader should first parse player config for direct media URLs, then fall back to HLS manifests and network inspection. yt-dlp remains the primary extraction tool, with ffmpeg and streamlink as reliable backups.

| Tool | Best Use Case | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| yt-dlp | Primary downloader for MP4/HLS | Supports cookies, format selection, retries |
| ffmpeg | Remuxing and validation | Useful for HLS to MP4 conversion |
| streamlink | Live/HLS fallback | Streams to file or pipes into ffmpeg |
| aria2c | Multi-connection HTTP/HLS downloads | Good for large files and retries |
| gallery-dl | Image-first or gallery-heavy sites | Best for gallery or attachment extraction |
